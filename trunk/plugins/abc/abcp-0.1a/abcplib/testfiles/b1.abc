% ABC Test Suite

% This file contains a graded series of tunes and excercises intended
% to test the conformance of abc music programs to the abc v1.6
% standard.  A few of these were written for the purpose, but most
% are taken either from the demo files which come with various
% abc programs or simply gathered from the net.  I have not always
% acknowledged the origin of these (I forgot where I got the tune
% from), so if you see a tune of yours used without due acknowledgement
% please let me know and I'll mark it or remove it as you wish.
% Each tune has at least one N: field with text describing any
% specific problems associated with the tune.
% Where I have edited a tune to bring it within the abc definition
% I have marked it so.  (e.g. editing the multiple slash timings out.)

% The abc standard is quite lax, in the sense that anything which is
% not expressly forbidden is permitted; so for example since the
% order of notes in chords is not specified you will find examples
% here of chords in low-to-high (LTH) order, high-to-low (HTL) and
% even random order.  All should be equally acceptable.  Essentially,
% I intend to include examples of all "reasonable" interpretations
% of the standard.  Of course there is immense scope for argument
% about what consists of a "reasonable" interpretation.

% Only abc 1.6 tunes without any of the more recent extensions are
% included, so no w: or V: fields, no inline fields or transposition
% directives are included.

% Not all features of abc are tested here.  One notable omission
% is the option of setting default metre/key/default note lengths
% etc. in the file header or in section headers.  It is not a widely
% used feature, and I am strongly of the opinion that it should
% not be used : tunes should be capable of standing alone so that
% they can be abstracted from their original files and still be
% usable.

Here's a bit of uncommented text between the tunes.  Programs
should ideally ignore it.  This is the only example of uncommented
text in this file, so if it causes problems for your program
you can comment it out.
